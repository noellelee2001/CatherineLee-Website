        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a first year studying psychology at UCR. I chose to study psychology because learning about the human brain and it's functions and processes is very intriguing to me. I believe that understanding how people think and process information is crucial to how the world functions and operates. Without this knowledge, predicting people's behaviors, understanding their motives, and making reasonable assumptions would be nearly impossible. I would like to apply the knowledge that I gain from studying psychology to the field of education, but more specifically, elementary school education.<br><br>

        As well as studying psychology, I would also like to study education. Children have always been a big part of my life, whether it be babysitting, Sunday school teaching, or tutoring. However, I always felt the need to have a better understanding of how to communicate with them without contributing to their collection of bad memories, which could result in bad behaviors. I have had encounters with many children whose parents do not understand that their methods of discipline are actually hurting their children in more ways than they could possibly imagine. The main reason why this desire of mine is so strong is because I received really good parenting as a child, and even now. So, I would really like to give show other students the kind of care and attention they may lack through a style of teaching rooted in a thorough understanding of how children's behaviors develop.<br><br>

        Although succeeding academically and financially is important to me, my main goal is to be able to glorify God in everything I do, whether it be in school, work, or everyday interactions. My faith is a significant part of my life, so being able to show love to those around me is my utmost priority. While I am in school, I would like to put in as much effort as I can loving others who are difficult for me to love. I believe that love is a choice and when I choose to love someone, it should not be contingent on how they are or how I feel about them. It should overlook the things I dislike about them and it should also be "until the end." If I can do this, then hopefully other people will see their need for Jesus.
